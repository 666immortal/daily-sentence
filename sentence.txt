每日一句 2019-02-20.md:> **Understanding how languages emerges [^1] and survive [^2]** holds great interest for [^3] researchers, since many languages are slipping away [^4] in increasing numbers [^5] around the world. **Uncommon languages** [^6] are better equipped to [^7] survive, researchers are learning, when young people are actively speaking them, whether in a family setting [^8], in a school system, or in immersion programs [^9].
每日一句 2019-02-21.md:> In short,[^1] **the Green New Deal's supporters** hope that **industrial policy** [^2] can now bring forth [^3] another transition [^4] to cheaper energy, faster trains, and an altogether more climate-friendly economy [^5]. But **a group of scholars** argue that **the United States** has neglected its domestic manufacturing sector [^6] since the 1980s, a move that risks [^7] national failure.
每日一句 2019-02-22.md:> **We** live in a time when **technological change** is portrayed as [^1] an inexorable [^2], impersonal [^3] force: **we**'d better learn how to surf the tsunami [^4] or drown [^5]. But as a society, **we** always have a choice about which direction we take next. **Technology** isn't just something that happens to [^6] us; it's something that decide to build and to use, or not.
每日一句 2019-02-23.md:> While a majority of Republicans [^1] supports the president's decision, **some conservatives** [^2], especially those concerned about constitutional rule [^3] and limited government [^4], are finding it hard to get behind [^5] a move [^6] that risks [^7] expanding presidential power.
每日一句 2019-02-24.md:> **It** looked more than a little [^1] weird [^2]: **One of America's most successful companies** decides not to locate a headquarters [^3] in New York, and **some of the city's most prominent [^4] politicians** cheer [^5].
每日一句 2019-02-25.md:> Meanwhile, inspired partly by [^1] Donald Trump, **==politicians== <u>from Syria to Spain</u>** now openly attack reporters, calling them "fake" or "biased", accusing them of [^2] twisting reality [^3]. **The public**, meanwhile, see journalists as too soft on power or too close to the wealthy and don't trust what they perceive as [^4] conflicts of interest [^5].
每日一句 2019-02-26.md:> **Apple** issued [^1] a warning to developers last week after **a TechCrunch report** revealed [^2] that a number of banking and travel companies had contracted [^3] with an analytics firm, Glassbox, to record customers' screens as they used their apps.
每日一句 2019-02-27.md:> Similarly, **==the trend== <u>for the heaviest social media users</u> ~~to go to sleep late~~** may be down to [^1] teenagers who naturally fall asleep late using social media [^2] in bed until they feel tired.
每日一句 2019-02-28.md:> **==Testimony== [^1] <u>from industry groups [^2] and advocates</u>** [^3] previewed [^4] plenty of buzzy topics [^5] that legislators [^6] are likely to probe [^7], from discriminatory pricing [^8] to limits on processing [^9] certain types of data. But **lawmakers** are split [^10] most starkly [^11] over the question of whether a federal law should supersede [^12] or take the place of state statutes [^13].
每日一句 2019-03-01.md:> **Some eastern people** believe animals are conscious beings [^1] that experience, in varying degrees [^2], emotions analogous to [^3] human desire, fear, pain, sorrow, and joy. **==This idea== <u>that animals are conscious</u>** was long unpopular [^4] in the West, but it has lately found favor among [^5] scientists who study animal cognition.
每日一句 2019-03-02.md:> **Michael Cohen's testimony** [^1] is as unprecedented [^2] as it is stunning [^3]: **==A direct witness== [^4] <u>to the actions of the president of the United States</u>** presented specific evidence of the president's decades-old pattern of lying, financial fraud [^5], intimidation [^6] and betrayal [^7] of his country for personal gain.
每日一句 2019-03-03.md:> **States** have very different ways of recognizing online accounts and data. **Some** treat digital assets [^1] as property [^2] like a car or a savings account [^3]. **Others** treat digital assets as [^4] private data that shouldn't be accessed [^5] by anyone else. In general, **tech companies** won't turn over [^6] your data without your express consent [^7], though some make exceptions for [^8] heirs [^9].
每日一句 2019-03-04.md:> **Figures [^1] <u>from the Higher Education Statistics Agency</u>** have shown that **Oxford and Cambridge** are almost alone among the competitive British universities in failing to expand their intake [^2] of domestic undergraduates while slowly increasing the proportion [^3] of sought-after [^4] places going to EU and international students.
每日一句 2019-03-05.md:> With **their $26.5 billion merger** hanging in the balance [^1], **top executives of T-mobile and Sprint** are taking their case to Congress, arguing that joining their companies [^2] won't hurt competition or jack up [^3] consumer prices for wireless service [^4].
每日一句 2019-03-06.md:>**==AT&T's victory== <u>over [^1] the government's attempt</u> ~~to block its $85 billion takeover [^2] of Time Warner~~** underscores [^3] just how much the way people watch - and pay for - TV has changed. **It** also highlights [^4] how corporate  America [^5] wants to adapt to deal with its new environment. In short: Bigger is better.
每日一句 2019-03-07.md:> If we hope to raise kids who are brave, competent [^1] and resourceful [^2], **we** have to let them step out into the world on their own, away from our relentless [^3], watchful [^4] eyes, and with a realistic perspective [^5] on the dangers they face. **We** must, as psychologist Laurence Steinberg writes, "protect when you must, but permit when you can."
每日一句 2019-03-08.md:> **The Democratic National Committee (DNC)** [^1] has decided to exclude Fox News Channel from [^2] televising any of its candidate debates [^3] during the 2019-2020 cycle as a result of published revelations [^4] detailing [^5] the cable network's [^6] close ties [^7] to the Trump administration [^8].
每日一句 2019-03-09.md:> **The number of people killed on the roads** was falling steadily in the UK until 2010, at which point the decline [^1] suddenly ended. Why? Because, while fewer drivers and passengers are dying, **the number of pedestrians [^2] killed** has risen by 11%.
每日一句 2019-03-10.md:> **San Francisco** now serves as a metaphor [^1] for how **tech money**    [^2] can transform even one of the most charming and energetic cities into a place where **no teachers** can afford to live, even **young rich people** are terrified [^3] of losing their apartments, and **longtime residents** [^4] grumble [^5] under their breath as they wander [^6] through suddenly alien [^7] streets.
每日一句 2019-03-11.md:> Wages grew 3.4 percent in the past year, **the government** reported Friday, the fastest pace in nearly a decade and well above inflation [^1], suggesting that employers are striving to lure [^2] and retain [^3] workers. **Many** are slashing requirements [^4] for jobs and hiring workers quickly to prevent them from being employed by competitors, a far cry [^5] from the days when job seekers felt lucky to even get a callback [^6].
每日一句 2019-03-12.md:> **Britain** is a long way from [^1] the drug abuse [^2] on the US scale, and **this** is a tribute to [^3] the superiority [^4] of single-player healthcare. **The NHS** is stretched and imperfect [^5], **but its mere [^6] existence** has prevented the abuses which produced the US crisis.
每日一句 2019-03-13.md:> Fifteen years later, **Harvard students and faculty** [^1] still remember those early months watching the new network generate [^2] a new kind of reality, one where your online activity become permanently [^3] entangled [^4] with your offline self, where a relationship wasn't real unless it was posted to Facebook, where everyone was assumed to have an online presence [^5].
每日一句 2019-03-14.md:> **Central to [^1] the lawsuit** is an evaluation of whether members of the men's and women's teams perform substantially [^2] the same job.

每日一句 2019-03-15.md:> While [^1] boosting [^2] science education remains a good idea, and not only because of the expected economic benefit, **the humanities** [^3] matter [^4] too - even if their contribution is less easily measured in our instrumentalist [^5] age.
每日一句 2019-03-16.md:> While measuring the clarity of our streams, the vibrance [^1] of our meadows [^2] and the health of our wildlife in financial terms [^3] can help to persuade the Hammonds of the world [^4] of [^5] their value, **the government** must not succumb to [^6] the idea that the living systems we depend on are replaceable [^7]. **Industries <u>generating profits from destruction</u>** will never be more valuable than the skies, the rivers and the landscapes [^8] they pollute.
每日一句 2019-03-17.md:> As the world was grounding [^1] 737 Max airliners this week, following [^2] the second crash involving the new jet in five months, **the Trump administration** [^3], serving as [^4] a wholly owned subsidiary [^5] of Boeing, declared "no basis to order grounding." **This** from [^6] an administration and president that claim climate change is a hoax [^7], radiation and pesticides are healthy, and that "raking" [^8] prevents forest fires. When President Trump finally buckled to pressure [^9] and grounded the 737 Max on Wednesday, **he** said he "maybe didn't have to" but thought it important [^10] "psychologically [^11]."
每日一句 2019-03-18.md:> ==Julie Schablitsky==, the chief archaeologist [^1] with the Maryland state highway administration [^2], ==told the Post the discovery==, based on saliva [^3] absorbed [^4] into the the clay pipe [^5], was a "mind-blower [^6]".
每日一句 2019-03-19.md:> Yet [^1], contrary to expectations [^2], **Americans in remote locations** [^3] did not rely more online shopping [^4]. Instead [^5], **the researchers** found people in more densely populated areas [^6] were more likely to do their shopping online, though that may also be tied to [^7] education levels [^8] and access to Internet connections [^9] and banking services [^10].
每日一句 2019-03-20.md:> Fashion brands' recent, mostly half-hearted [^1] **attempts** at entering the plus-size market [^2] suggest a certain amount of fear on the part of those running the industry. **American culture** doesn't like fat people very much, and what if [^3] **courting [^4] larger shoppers** [^5] will make their stores seem uncool?
每日一句 2019-03-21.md:> **Those who study social media** say that slowing the spread of appalling [^1] videos might require the companies to change or limit some features [^2] that help spread stimulating content [^3]. **Those** include powerful search and recommendation algorithms [^4], nearly instantaneous uploads and autoplay [^5].
每日一句 2019-03-22.md:> **The Federal Reserve** on Wednesday suggested [^1] it would not raise interest rates [^2] in 2019, a dramatic about-face [^3] that indicated [^4] the central bank [^5]'s worries about the economy are intensifying [^6]. "Growth is slowing somewhat more than expected," **Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell** said at a news conference. "While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of a slowdown [^7] through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed [^8]."
每日一句 2019-03-23.md:> The country is facing the "jaws of death [^1]", Sir James Bevan said, at the point where **water demand** from the country's rising population surpasses [^2] the falling supply resulting from climate change. However, **this** could be avoided with ambitious action to cut people's water use by a third and leakage from water company pipes by 50%, he says, along with [^3] big new reservoirs [^4] and transfers [^5] of water across the country.
每日一句 2019-03-24.md:> **Trump** is right that **unemployment rates <u>for black and Hispanic Americans</u>** [^1] hit record lows during his presidency [^2]. But **unemployment <u>among those groups</u>** has been falling since 2010. And **unemployment numbers <u>for these groups</u>** remain [^3] higher than those for white Americans.
每日一句 2019-03-25.md:> For many children, **teaching assistants** offer support in a variety of ways. Not only do **they** break down [^1] the lesson in a way children can understand, but often **they** are the ones who are available to offer the emotional support [^2] to those who find learning difficult due to various reasons such as speech and language barriers [^3], social deprivation [^4] or special educational needs and disability [^5].
每日一句 2019-03-26.md:> It is important **to draw a distinction [^1] between grade inflation [^2] and grade improvement** [^3], where increased investment in teaching and facilities [^4], as well as students working harder than ever, are leading to legitimate [^5] increases in grades.
每日一句 2019-03-27.md:> **The Justice Department's position ~~supporting the judge's ruling~~** [^1] would potentially eliminate [^2] health care for millions of people and create widespread disruption [^3] across the U.S. health-care system - from removing [^4] no-charge [^5] preventive services [^6] for older Americans on Medicare to voiding [^7] the expansion [^8] of Medicaid [^9] in most states. (from...to...表示列举有哪些破坏)
每日一句 2019-03-28.md:> Under the ruling -- which will take effect [^1] in 60 days, pending [^2] an appeal [^3] from the state or revised [^8] legislation -- **women** will be able to seek abortions [^4] at any point before a doctor determines the fetus [^5] is "viable" [^6] and could be able to survive outside the womb [^7].
每日一句 2019-03-29.md:> **Nutt** has long been developing a holy grail [^1] of molecules -- also referred to as "alcosynth" -- that will provide the relaxing [^2] and socially lubricating [^3] qualities of alcohol, but without the hangovers [^4], health issues and the risk of getting paralytic [^5]. **It** sounds too good to be true, and when I discuss the notion with two alcohol industry experts, **they** draw parallels with [^6] plans to colonise Mars [^7]. 
每日一句 2019-03-30.md:> **An NHS England spokesman** said: "While antidepressants [^1] play an important role for some patients, **an attitude of 'a pill for every ill'** can mean not only do some people end up [^2] taking medicine they don't need to, but taxpayer funding [^3] is spent on avoidable [^4] prescriptions [^5]."
每日一句 2019-03-31.md:> **The vanishing [^1] <u>of coal plants</u> [^2] ~~from the American landscape~~** [^3] began years ago, but it has persisted [^4] under President Trump [^5], who came into office [^6] promising to revitalize [^7] the coal industry [^8].
每日一句 2019-04-01.md:> **There are benefits** to low-wage workers [^1] of hiking [^2] the minimum [^3], **but also dangers** -- most prominently [^4], a heightened [^5] risk that employers will cut jobs and hours, or substitute machinery for labor [^6].
每日一句 2019-04-02.md:> With just a year to go before the 2020 Census [^1], **the U.S. government** is urgently [^2] working to safeguard against hacking [^3] and disinformation campaigns [^4] as it perfects [^5] a plan to count about 330 million people largely on-line for the first time.
每日一句 2019-04-03.md:> **Details of the plans** are sketchy [^1] but **it** appears Apple will be launching [^2] a new platform for news publishers [^3] with paywalls [^4] -- the Wall Street Journal is in, New York Times and Washington Post are not -- and announcing a series of new TV deals and original programmers [^5] that will put it head to head [^6] with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and their rivals [^7] in streaming media [^8] as they fight it out to be the new kings of Hollywood.
每日一句 2019-04-04.md:> Too often, **prosecutors** [^1] don't even try to hold top executives [^2] criminally accountable [^3]. **They** claim it's too hard to prove that the people at the top knew about the corporate misconduct [^4]. **This attitude** distorts [^5] the incentives for corporate leaders. The message to executives? So long as [^6] you bury your head in the sand, you can keep collecting fat bonuses [^7] without risk of facing criminal liability [^8]. 
每日一句 2019-04-05.md:> In an era of glass and steel construction, **wood** may seem old-school [^1]. But now **researchers** say they have given timber [^2] a makeover [^3] to produce a material that is not only sturdy [^4], but also transparent [^5] and able to store and release heat [^6].
每日一句 2019-04-06.md:> **Warren's legislation** [^1] has little chance of  [^2] Sanate [^3] passage [^4] and was quickly criticized by business groups and white-collar defense attorneys [^5] as [^6] criminalizing [^7] normal corporate behavior [^8].
每日一句 2019-04-07.md:> if **unpaid, caring work** [^1] including parenting [^2] could, over time [^3], be more evenly [^4] distributed [^5] between men and women, and personal life better balanced with paid work [^6], **it** would benefit us all.
每日一句 2019-04-08.md:> **The IMF's real headache** is that **the flaws <u>in the global economy ~~exposed by the financial crisis~~</u>** were papered over [^1] rather than properly dealt with. A decade of cheap money [^2] has resulted in a build-up of debt [^3], excessive speculation [^4], asset price [^5] growth and a sense that the bubble is about to burst [^6].
每日一句 2019-04-09.md:> **Executives [^1] of these companies** are fully aware [^2] that consumers are nervous, and that a security breach [^3] could be a company-ending [^4] event. **The app companies <u>quoted in this article</u>** say they never sell user data, don't allow advertisers to use data for targeting [^5], and keep the data securely encrypted [^6].
每日一句 2019-04-10.md:> **Economists** debate the reasons behind the so-called "productivity puzzle". **Some** believe gains from new digital technologies are not being captured [^1] by the figures [^2], while others argue that a decade of government austerity [^3] and soft business investment [^4] are taking their toll [^5].  
每日一句 2019-04-11.md:> As **U.S. economic <u>growth in the past decade</u>** assumed [^1] an increasingly urban character [^2], **that diverse set of strengths** [^3] enabled this town to [^4] defy [^5] a pervasive [^6] narrative [^7] of rural decline [^8].
每日一句 2019-04-12.md:> But **black holes** are so small, dark and distant that **observing them directly** requires a telescope with a resolution [^1] equivalent to [^2] being able to see a bagel [^3] on the moon. **This** was once thought to be an insurmountable [^4] challenge.
每日一句 2019-04-13.md:> **A US firm** targeting [^1] first-year university students and offering to write essays for £7 a page, posts messages on accommodation [^2] and course [^3] group chats created to help freshers [^4] settle into [^5] university life, boasting [^6] that students can "pay after delivery [^7]".
每日一句 2019-04-14.md:> **Those 16 parents** had previously been charged with conspiracy [^1] to commit fraud [^2]. **Prosecutors** [^3] say the parents sought to ease [^4] their children's admission to selective colleges [^5], in a scheme [^6] that used bribery to cheat on standardized exams and to falsely portray their children as [^7] athletic recruits [^8].
每日一句 2019-04-15.md:> Instead, **statisticians** use models to figure out how much added risk there is to eating too much salt or not enough beans, then apply those risks to the recorded deaths from diseases you might get from those poor dietary choices.
每日一句 2019-04-16.md:> **The lesson of the financial crisis** is that it wasn't just the product of overzealous [^1] regulators [^2] or greedy [^3] capitalists. **They** played a role, but **the larger role** was played by the convergence [^4] of  many forces that we understand only in retrospect [^5] and can control only with difficulty [^6].
每日一句 2019-04-17.md:> Yet there is no better way to support family life and the lives of an older generation that is increasingly [^1] infirm [^2] than by sharing what income and wealth we have.
每日一句 2019-04-18.md:> Citing [^1] differences over [^2] climate change, **Royal Dutch Shell** [^3] has pulled out of [^4] an industry trade group called the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers [^5]. **Shell** said that it was at odds with [^6] the refining and petrochemical group on the Paris climate agreement, carbon pricing [^7], fuel mandates [^8] and the reduction of methane emissions [^9].
每日一句 2019-04-19.md:> **What grabs [^1] fewer headlines** is that there are plenty of [^2] behaviors that require self-control [^3] that have held steady [^4] or even improved in recent decades. **Cigarette smoking** has fallen sharply since the Mad Men [^5] days. **Alcohol consumption** peaked [^6] in 1980 and has fallen back to the same level as 1960.
每日一句 2019-04-20.md:> **Supporting homeless people to achieve their potential** [^1] matters [^2] now more than ever. For this vulnerable group [^3], with complex needs aggravated [^4] by barriers [^5] to basic services such as housing, health, employment and benefits, **attending university** is low on the list of aspirations [^6]. Yet for many, **a university education** will help them get their lives fully on track, enabling them to find fulfilling work [^7] and a regular income [^8].
每日一句 2019-04-21.md:> **We** usually think laughter [^1] is primarily [^2] something we do when we find something funny, but in fact **most laughter** is produced for social reasons -- **we** are 30 times more likely to laugh if there is someone else with us than when we are on our own.
每日一句 2019-04-22.md:> **The District** plans to crack down on [^1] drivers who park [^2] in or block [^3] bike lanes and put cyclists [^4] at risk by creating a team of bike-lane enforcement officers [^5] with the power to issue tickets [^6] on the scene and by mail.
每日一句 2019-04-23.md:> Disappointingly [^1], **journalism** [^2] is falling behind other sectors of elitism [^3] such as law and banking, which are doing more to compensate glaring [^4] inequalities [^5].
每日一句 2019-04-24.md:> **German prosecutors** [^1] charged [^2] former Volkswagen [^3] CEO Martin Winterkorn and four others with  fraud [^4] in the emissions [^5] cheating scandal that has helped turn many Europeans against [^6] diesel engines [^7] and accelerated the push [^8] toward electric cars.
每日一句 2019-04-25.md:> However, **Spence** said **the research** might help to unpick [^1] some of the unexplained [^2] phenomena [^3] around taste, pointing out that previous experiments have found people could still discriminate between foods that are only expected to differ [^4] by their odours [^5] even when their nose was not involved.
每日一句 2019-04-26.md:> **Zuckerberg** also expressed confidence that the company could "strengthen privacy [^1] without meaningfully [^2] impacting [^3] our business", though **the chief financial officer, David Wehner**, warned that the company expects [^4] revenue growth rates [^5] to "decelerate [^6] sequentially [^7]" due to "ad-targeting [^8]-related headwinds [^9]".
每日一句 2019-04-27.md:> **Trump** has threatened to lead another shutdown [^1] after the September deadline if **his funding priorities** aren't met. **They** include an additional increase in military spending [^2], more money to construct a wall on the Mexico border, and big budget cuts [^3] for things like housing, education, environmental protection and foreign aid. **Many Democrats** [^4] have rejected these priorities [^5], creating a possible deadlock [^6] because they control the House of Representatives [^7]. 
每日一句 2019-04-28.md:> The uneasy relationship between dentist [^1] and patient is further complicated [^2] by an unfortunate reality: Common dental procedures are not always as safe, effective, or durable [^3] as we are meant to believe. As a profession, dentistry [^4] has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny [^5] as medicine, or embraced as sweeping [^6] an emphasis on scientific evidence.
每日一句 2019-04-29.md:> **The gun rights group** [^1], which spent $31 million to help elect President Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign [^2], has been operating in the red [^3] ever since, according to financial records [^4]. Despite having a Supreme Court that now tips toward [^5] Second Amendment rights [^6], a Republican president and, until November, a Republican-controlled Congress [^7], **the organization** has not been able to push forward much of its agenda [^8] in Washington.
每日一句 2019-04-30.md:> **Balancing the benefits more humanlike AI could bring with the risk for abuse [^1]** is a tortured [^2] task from a practical point of view [^3]. From a more human one, however, **it** can be hard not to hope [^4] **the tide [^5] of technological change** will roll in [^6] slowly. **Those hidden meanings, mystifying relationships and even groan-worthy [^7] puns [^8] that stump [^9] machines** are what make Shakespeare Shakespeare. **They**'re also what make us us.
每日一句 2019-05-01.md:> **President Donald Trump's 2020 budget proposal** [^1] argues that the benefit is not only complicated for borrowers to navigate [^2], but **it** also inefficiently [^3] targets subsidies [^4] only to those borrowers in public service jobs. **Senate Democrats** believe that Congress should maintain but repair and improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so **it** is easier to understand and operate, and better targeted at occupations taxpayers actually want to subsidize with their generosity [^5].
每日一句 2019-05-02.md:> But everybody knows Obama needs a liberal [^1] to stop the court [^2] from moving further to the right [^3] than it already has under John Roberts [^4], the present chief justice, a man more stealth-bomber [^5] than aircraft-carrier [^6], whose professions [^7] of judicial modesty [^8] during his own confirmation hearings [^9] in 2005 gave little inkling of [^10] the controversial [^11] decisions over which he has since presided [^12].
每日一句 2019-05-03.md:> **The Federal Reserve** [^1] left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, defying [^2] a push from President Trump for lower rates intended to stimulate [^3] the economy. "It appears that [^4] risks have moderated [^5] somewhat," **Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H.Powell** said Wednesday, pointing to improving global growth and financial market conditions and optimism about trade tensions easing [^6].
每日一句 2019-05-05.md:> As the economy continues to grow past [^1] what many predicted was possible, **some analysts and officials** are wondering [^2] if the current state of the economy [^3] is too good to be true [^4] -- and that experts must be missing warning signs [^5].
每日一句 2019-05-06.md:> Rarely has **the search for new knowledge**, undertaken by a university of world renown [^1], been so vocally [^2] condemned [^3]. **That** is what happened when Cambridge University announced a new academic research project to determine the extent to which the university "contributed to [^4], benefited from [^5] or challenged [^6]" slavery and the slave trade.
每日一句 2019-05-07.md:> **The law**, which is set to [^1] come into effect [^2] from 1 March 2022 if it passes through parliament [^3] before the end of this year, would make vaccination against measles [^4] mandatory for all children attending nurseries [^5] and schools, as well as teachers, educators and medical staff at hospitals and surgeries.
